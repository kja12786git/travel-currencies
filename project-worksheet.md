# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Approval From Squad Lead
|---|---| ---|
|Day 1: Fri| Game Idea, Wireframes and Priority Matrix|
|Day 2: Mon| Pseudocode\Actual code\Basic Clickable Model|
|Day 3: Tue| Working Prototype |
|Day 4: Wed| App Completed / Slides |
|Day 5: Thur| Project Presentations |

## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.

  **An input form which user can insert amount of base currency then they receive a result based on the selected destination currency.**

## POST MVP

Include the full list of features that you are considering for POST MVP

## App Components

  As part of MVP:

    One page user experience...

    * Form for user input amount and pulls data on user change.
    * Base currency set based on api.
    * Destination currency selectable.
    * Result returns calculated amount * value of selected currency.

    Editable Data (beyond the initial experience)
    * User can add destination currencies not listed to use in form.
    * User can remove or edit details of existing destination currency such as name of country associated with symbol.

    Additional  
    * Layout design.
    * Google maps page using google maps api corresponds to destination currency.

### Creating Items
  **A user ought to be able to add most currencies not listed on the default list. **

### Deleting Items
  **A user ought to be able to remove a currency from those available. **

### Editing Items
  **A user ought to be able to edit currency detail such as name of country or change symbol detail from those available. **

### Getting Items
  **Selecting a currency will pull additional details from the database to enhance the DOM display. **

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| The Initial Experience | H | 16hrs| 13hrs | - |
| Editable Data | H | 5hrs| 4hrs | - |
| Reworking/Polishing | H | 5hrs| 7hrs | - |
| FE/Layout and Maps | L | 3hrs| 1hr | - |


## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description |
| --- | :---: |  
| Pending | I can share some code snippet here |

## Additional Libraries
 jQuery may be used for some basic DOM functions.

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  

## jQuery Discoveries
 Use this section to list some, but not all, of the jQuery methods and\or functionality discovered while working on this project.

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  

## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                
**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object
